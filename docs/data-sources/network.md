# cidr_network (Data Source)

Use this data source to manipulate network addresses, such as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, subnets, masks and prefixes.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "cidr_network" "example1" {
  prefix = "192.168.2.56/29"
}

data "cidr_network" "example2" {
  ip   = "192.168.2.57"
  mask = "255.255.255.248"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **ip** (String) The IPv4 or IPv6 address (such as `10.0.0.1` or `2001:db8::68`).
- **mask** (String) The IPv4 or IPv6 network mask (such as `255.0.0.0` or `ffff:ffff:ffff::`).
- **prefix** (String) The IPv4 or IPv6 address and network mask in CIDR notation. The address may denote a specific address (using a host identifier, such as `10.0.0.1/8`), or the beginning address of an entire network (using a host identifier of 0, such as `10.0.0.0/8`).

### Read-Only

- **broadcast** (String) The IPv4 broadcast address (such as `10.255.255.255`).
- **first_ip** (String) The first IPv4 or IPv6 address in the CIDR range (such as `10.0.0.1` or `2001:db8::`).
- **hostnum** (String) The hostnum (such as `1`).  Can be used in cidrhost
- **last_ip** (String) The last IPv4 or IPv6 address in the CIDR range (such as `10.255.255.254` or `2001:db8:0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`).
- **mask_bits** (Number) The number of bits in the IPv4 or IPv6 network mask.
- **network** (String) The IPv4 or IPv6 network in CIDR notation (such as `10.0.0.0/8` or `2001:db8::/48`).
